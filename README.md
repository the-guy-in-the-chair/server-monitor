# Server Monitor
This is a custom Server Monitor app I built for my personal home server, but it can easily be modified for your personal configuration. It has light management abilites (start/stop/restart services) and is only available through the local network. To access it remotely a Tailscale or similar connection must be used.

This application was written in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and Flask was used for the webserver. GitHub Copilot was also used for fast prototyping.
